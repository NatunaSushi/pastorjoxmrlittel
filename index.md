## Pastor Jo and Mr Littel are the bestest ship dont @ me





```markdown
In the darkness of that night, away from the preying eyes and ears of those who would judge, some strangers slipped by unnoticed.

But they were not strangers, they knew each-other. And they knew each-other much closer then any of their friends did realize.
They knew each-other both inside and out. But their friends did not know this. Their friends could not know. Their friends should not know this.
Nor could they know. Because it was night, and thus away from their viscous, judging eyeballs.

"Is it safe?" said the first stranger, who was not a stranger to the other stranger but will remain a stranger to us for the moment.

"I think so. Its dark so none of the others should see us here, even if they are nearby. I think our secret is safe."

"Good. I couldn't take their judgement right now. My life is too stressful as it is. If it wasn't for you I don't know what Id do."
"Don't worry Hero name, I will always be here for you - waiting in the dark"
"Thanks, Mr. Littel. I will always be in the dark for you too"

With that the two shadows embraced - an embracement in the night full of passion and romance.
This is the story of a time long ago– a time of myth and legend......
For a moment time seemed to slowed down. Hero name wondered why. Hero name turned around slowly (due to the time seeming to have slowed down).
Then the explanation - Mr. Littel was secretly looking at him. Looking at him in that special way.
Hero names soul lit up like a beacon in the night - even though it was day.

In all of this. In all of this mess. They had eachother, even if eachother was the only ones that knew.
Mr. Littel turned away at that moment - Time jumped back to normal as Hero name was no longer transfixiated by Mr. Littel.
Fortunately no one else had noticed.
Some time later in their secret hide-away ;

"I am glade we found a way to survive all that and still be together"
"Yes, our plan seems to have worked despite all the events"
"Do you think anyone spotted us?"
"No"
"No"
"Yes"
Ebolia emerged from the shadows of the darkness.
"I know everything" he said. 
Hero name and Mr. Littel gasped. Their secret was finally revealed!

"I dont love Mr. Littel like you do" said Ebolia "but I have always lusted a bit after them. So you see if Mr. Littel spends the night with me - I will never tell anyone."
Hero name breathed a sigh of relief. That was, after all, a reasonable request. They agreed to the bargain.
"Phwee...thats something we can go along with" said Mr. Littel relieved.
Ebolia was happy, and Hero name and Mr. Littel thus got to live happily ever after together. With no one but Ebolia and themselves ever knowing.

"Wait," said Paula to Hero name. "Waitup!"
Hero name waited for her to arrive.

~~~United forever in friendship and labour,
Our mighty republics will ever endure. ~~~

"I have to tell you something," Paula said while she barely dared to look at Hero name.
"What is it," Hero name said, "You can tell me anything."

~~~The Great Soviet Union will live through the ages.
The dream of a people their fortress secure.~~~

"It's.... I think.... I'm not sure but... oh gosh, I'm embarrising myself, Paula said with the cuttest giggle Hero name had ever seen her show.

~~~Long live our Soviet motherland,
Built by the people's mighty hand.
Long live our people, united and free.
Strong in our friendship tried by fire.~~~

"I think I... I think I love Mr. Littel!"

And with those words, Hero name's heart sank. Because really... really he loved Paula. 

~~~Long may our crimson flag inspire,
Shining in glory for all men to see.~~~

Hero name sat there, at home, in Candler. But he didn't want to go anywhere. The weigh on his heart was too heavy to bare. And so he laid down on his bed and stared at the ceiling while listening to his favourite songs.

~~~Through days dark and stormy where Great Lenin lead us
Our eyes saw the bright sun of freedom above
And Stalin our leader with faith in the people,
Inspired us to build up the land that we love.~~~

Hero name then rose up again. He would not give up that easily! No, Paula's love would be hiss! 

~~~Long live our Soviet motherland,
Built by the people's mighty hand.
Long live our people, united and free.
Strong in our friendship tried by fire.
Long may our crimson flag inspire,
Shining in glory for all men to see.~~~

"Paula!" Hero name yelled. She looked up. She with her beautiful orangelike eyes. Hero name couldn't wait to tell her his true feelings! 
Paula, Hero name said with a quivering lip. His heart beating like a drum. 
"I love you."

~~~We fought for the future, destroyed the invaders,
And brought to our homeland the laurels of fame.
Our glory will live in the memory of nations
And all generations will honour her name.~~~

Paula looked up at him and said those simple, beautiful words: "I think I love you too."

~~~Long live our Soviet motherland,
Built by the people's mighty hand.
Long live our people, united and free.
Strong in our friendship tried by fire.
Long may our crimson flag inspire,
Shining in glory for all men to see.~~~
